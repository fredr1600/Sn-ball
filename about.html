			<h1>About us</h1>

			<p>
				We are four students who studies first year applied computer technology at Oslo Metropolitan University. 
				In the webproject-course we’re currently taking, we choose to do a mandatory assignment called Snowball Challenge. 
				The assignment involves working in pairs and brainstorming ideas, then finding another pair to team up with. 
				As a group of four we then agreed on which idea we wanted to make a website for.
				And in the end we found another group of four to give us feedback on the website.
				<br><br>
				This is our case: “Create a low-tech or high-tech solution that works for everyone. 
				The solution could be a redesign of an existing solution or a completely new product or service. 
				The sky is the limit. Identify a problem, and create a product or service that solves the problem.” 
				And the website you’re currently visiting is our solution to our worlds overpopulation.
