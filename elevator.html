			<h1>The Elevator</h1>

			<p>The elevator itself will be placed near the equator. The whole project requires a base-station,
				a cable, and a counterweight. Climbers will move along the cable with goods and people. At the end
				of the cable there will be a docking station. This will act as a counterweight, as well as a 
				place where spaceships and stations can connect to receive fuel, drop off crew etc.
